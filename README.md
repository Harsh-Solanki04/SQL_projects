# SQL_projects

I'm teaching myself MySQL by working on some very interesting projects. Some of these are guided projects by Alex Freburg- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUaB-1hjhk8FE_XZ87vPPSfHqb6OcM0cF
The csv file is the data I'm working with.
The rest of the files containg SQL code along with comments for the viewer's understanding.
